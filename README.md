# Students-Performance-Predictor
Overview

The Student Performance Predictor analyzes multiple input features and estimates a student’s expected marks or performance trend. This project demonstrates how basic regression techniques can be used to build simple yet effective predictive models for academic analytics.

🎯 Features

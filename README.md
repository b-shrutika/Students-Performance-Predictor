# Students-Performance-Predictor
Overview

The Student Performance Predictor analyzes multiple input features and estimates a student’s expected marks or performance trend. This project demonstrates how basic regression techniques can be used to build simple yet effective predictive models for academic analytics.

🎯 Features

📊 Predicts student performance using Linear Regression

🎓 Uses factors such as study hours, attendance, and past scores

📈 Identifies trends and performance improvement areas

🧹 Clean preprocessing and data handling

📑 Easy-to-understand implementation suitable for beginners

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression model)

📂 Project Structure
│── data.csv                # Dataset containing student records
│── predictor.ipynb         # Jupyter notebook with model implementation
│── model.py                # Python script for training/evaluating the model
│── README.md               # Project documentation

🔧 How It Works

Load and preprocess the dataset

Select features like study hours, attendance, and previous marks

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate performance using metrics like MAE/MSE

Predict student scores based on new inputs
